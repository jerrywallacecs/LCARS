// I think I'll start putting any data calls here. need to move the GetSystemInfo stuff from SystemMonitor here too probably.
// Could also put the random data generation for LCARSDataCascade here too maybe. 
// Just to keep things tidy and separate from the components.



//API calls def need to go here to make it clean. Maybe we will make more service files to separate some of the logic. 


// This will likely be something that I work on once we get a complete prototype done.
