# LCARS

The **LCARS Interface** by Teal Inc. is a custom user interface inspired by the Star Trek LCARS system.  
It serves as a desktop overlay or UI/UX replacement for Windows, designed using **Electron** and **React**.

The application provides interactive features such as:

- A file explorer showing standard file information
- A settings page simulating core Windows functionality
- Clickable LCARS-style buttons for system commands (Wi-Fi toggle, audio, PowerShell, etc.)
- Additional features to streamline the Windows UI and enhance the user experience.
